## Getting started


### Using `degit`

To create a new project based on my source code locally, run

```bash
npx degit "msyyn/tabellius-frontend" my-app
```

[`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) is a scaffolding tool that lets you create a directory from a branch in a repository.

Replace `my-app` with the path where you wish to create the project.

### Running the project

Once you have created the project and configured it, install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open it and click around.

You now have a fully functional copy of the project. To get started developing, consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) documentation.

### Deploying to Vercel

You can deploy the build version to Vercel by installing the Vercel CLI.
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```
And then run the terminal command `vercel` in your app directory.
